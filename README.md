## Abstract

Locating undiscovered deposits of critical minerals requires accurate geological data. However, most of the 100,000 historical geological maps of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are in raster format. This hinders critical mineral assessment. We target the problem of extracting geological features represented as polygons from raster maps. We exploit the polygon metadata that provides information on the geological features, such as the map keys indicating how the polygon features are represented, to extract the features. We present a metadata-driven machine-learning approach that encodes the raster map and map key into a series of bitmaps and uses a convolutional model to learn to recognize the polygon features. We evaluated our approach on USGS geological maps; our approach achieves a median F1 score of 0.809 and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.52\%.



## Introduction


We address the problem of extracting geological features represented as polygons from raster maps. The input includes (1) a raster map and (2) a raster image of the map key from the map legend in the raster map. The output is a binary image for each geological feature in the raster map. We use 1s to represent the extracted polygon feature in the binary image.

The presented LOAM is a two-stage approach that exploits the polygon metadata to extract geological features from raster maps. Our method generates multiple representations of the map for each map key. These representations capture different aspects of map understanding, such as extracting polygon features based on colors, textual descriptions, and boundaries. Our method then leverages these representations to adaptively extract polygon features from maps of diverse styles.
